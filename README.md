## Introduction
Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions aims at providing one-time runtime context for Jenkins pipeline. The users are able to run the pipeline in GitHub Actions by only providing the Jenkinsfile and the definition of GitHub workflow. This project is powered by [jenkinsfile-runner](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner) mainly. The plugin downloading step is powered by [plugin-installation-manager-tool](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool).

You can configure the pipeline environment by using other GitHub Actions or providing JCasC Yaml file powered by [configuration-as-code-plugin](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/).

## Pre-requisites
The users need to create the workflow definition under the `.github/workflows` directory. Refer to the [example workflows](#example-workflows) for more details about these actions.

## Step by step usage
### Container actions usage
1. Prepare a Jenkinsfile in your repository. You can check [the basic syntax of Jenkins pipeline definition](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/).
2. Prepare a workflow definition under the `.github/workflows` directory. You can check [the official manual](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more details.
3. In your GitHub Action workflow definition, you need to follow these steps when calling other actions in sequence:
   1. Use a ubuntu runner for the job.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest   
   ```
   2. If you use jfr-container-action, you need to declare using the `ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master` or any image extended it. If you use jfr-static-image-action, you can skip this step.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container:
          image: ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master             
   ```   
   3. Call the `actions/checkout@v2` to pull your codes into the runner. "Call" means `uses` in the workflow definition specifically. You can check [the details about "uses" keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses).
   ```Yaml
   - uses: actions/checkout@v2
   ```
   4. Call the Jenkinsfile-runner actions.
      1. If you use jfr-container-action, you need to call `Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master` and give necessary inputs.
      ```Yaml
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml      
      ```
      2.  If you use jfr-static-image-action, you need to call `Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-static-image-action@master` and give necessary inputs. See the [examples](#example-workflows) for these two actions.
      ```Yaml
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml      
      ```
### Runtime actions usage
1. Prepare a Jenkinsfile in your repository.
2. Prepare a workflow definition under the `.github/workflows` directory.
3. In your GitHub Action workflow definition, you need to follow these steps when calling other actions in sequence:
   1. Use the runners you prefer. You can choose Linux, macOS or Windows.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest   
   ```   
   2. Call the `actions/checkout@v2` to pull your codes into the runner.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2           
   ```      
   3. Set up the Jenkins environment by using `Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-setup@master`.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uese: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-setup@master           
   ```    
   4. Install extra plugins by using `Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-plugin-installation-action@master`. This step is optional.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uese: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-setup@master
          - uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-plugin-installation-action@master
            with:
              pluginstxt: jenkins-setup/plugins.txt                     
   ```   
   5. Run the Jenkins pipeline by using `Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkinsfile-runner-action@master`.
   ```Yaml
   jobs:
      job-name:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - uese: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-setup@master
          - uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-plugin-installation-action@master
            with:
              pluginstxt: jenkins-setup/plugins.txt
          - uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkinsfile-runner-action@master
            with:
              command: run
              jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
              jcasc: jcasc.yml                                   
   ```    

## Example workflows
There are three common cases about how to play with these actions. Although the user interfaces are similar to each other, there are still some subtle differences. The runtime actions are deprecated now. The users can use the [jfr-container-action](#container-job-action) and [jfr-static-image-action](#docker-container-action).
### Container job action
This case is realized by jfr-container-action. If the job uses this action, it will run the Jenkins pipeline and other GitHub Actions in the prebuilt container provided by [ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/pkgs/container/jenkinsfile-runner). The **extra prerequisite** of this action is that you need to declare the image usage of ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master at the start of the job.
```Yaml
name: Java CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  jenkins-container-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: jenkins-prebuilt-container-test
    container:
      # prerequisite
      image: ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # jfr-container-action
      - name: Jenkins pipeline in the container
        id: jenkins_pipeline_container
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
```
Some users might want to configure the container environment. The recommendation is that you should extend the [ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/pkgs/container/jenkinsfile-runner) vanilla image and then you need to build and push it to your own registry. Finally, you can replace the vanilla image with your own custimized image. The invocation of jfr-container-action can be done in a similar way.
```Yaml
name: Java CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  jenkins-container-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: jenkins-prebuilt-container-test
    container:
      # prerequisite: extendance of ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master
      image: path/to/your_own_image
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # jfr-container-action
      - name: Jenkins pipeline in the container
        id: jenkins_pipeline_container
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
```
### Docker container action
This case is realized by jfr-static-image-action. This action has its own working environment. It won't have extra environment relationship with the on demand VM outside unless the user mounts other directories to the container (For example, checkout action if exists). After the docker action ends, this container will be deleted. The users may check the introduction of [Docker container action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action#introduction) before using this action.
```Yaml
name: Java CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  jenkins-static-image-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: jenkins-static-image-pipeline-test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # jfr-static-image-action
      - name: Jenkins pipeline with the static image
        id: jenkins_pipeline_image
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-static-image-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
```
### Runtime action
This case is realized by the combination of jenkins-setup, jenkins-plugin-installation-action and jenkinsfile-runner-action. It will download all the dependencies and run the pipeline at the host machine directly. Its advantage is that it can support Linux, macOS and Windows runners. Its main disadvantage is the possibility of suffering from a plugins.jenkins.io outage.
```Yaml
name: Java CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  jenkins-runtime-pipeline:
    # Run all the actions in the on demand VM.
    needs: syntax-check
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macOS-latest, windows-latest]    
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    name: jenkins-runtime-pipeline-test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name : Setup Jenkins
        uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-setup
      - name: Jenkins plugins download
        id: jenkins_plugins_download
        uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkins-plugin-installation-action
        with:
          pluginstxt: jenkins-setup/plugins.txt
      - name: Run Jenkins pipeline
        id: run_jenkins_pipeline
        uses: Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jenkinsfile-runner-action
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
```

## Advanced usage
### Cache new installed plugins
This feature is only available in `jfr-container-action`. By default, the plugins specified by `plugins.txt` will be downloaded from the Internet everytime you run the workflow. In order to accelarate the workflow, you can use `actions/cache` outside and give its cache hit status as input in `isPluginCacheHit`. There are three important details here.

1. The `path` input in `actions/cache` must be `/jenkins_new_plugins`.
2. If you want to use `plugins.txt` as `key` for cache, you need to keep the `key` input in `actions/cache` consistent with `pluginstxt` input in `jfr-container-action`.
3. You need to pass cache hit status by `isPluginCacheHit`. For example, ff the step id of your `actions/cache` step is `cache-jenkins-plugins`, the input of `isPluginCacheHit` should be `${{steps.cache-jenkins-plugins.outputs.cache-hit}}`.
```Yaml
      # Cache new plugins in /jenkins_new_plugins by hash(plugins.txt)
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        id: cache-jenkins-plugins
        name: Cache Jenkins plugins
        with:
          path: /jenkins_new_plugins
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-plugins-${{ hashFiles('plugins.txt') }}      
      - name: Jenkins pipeline in the container
        id: jenkins_pipeline_container
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
          isPluginCacheHit: ${{steps.cache-jenkins-plugins.outputs.cache-hit}}
``` 
### Pipeline log uploading service
This feature is available for `jfr-container-action` and `jfr-static-image-action`. After you run the Jenkins pipeline, the pipeline log will be available in `/jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds` for `jfr-container-action` and `jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds` for `jfr-static-image-action`. Therefore, you are able to upload the log to the GitHub Action page by using `actions/upload-artifact`.

Log uploading example for `jfr-container-action`.
```Yaml
      - name: Jenkins pipeline in the container
        id: jenkins_pipeline_container
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-container-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins_container.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
      # Upload pipeline log in /jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds
      - name: Upload pipeline Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: jenkins-container-pipeline-log
          path: /jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds
```
Log uploading example for `jfr-static-image-action`.
```Yaml
      - name: Jenkins pipeline with the static image
        id: jenkins_pipeline_image
        uses:
          Cr1t-GYM/jenkins-action-poc/jfr-static-image-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins_container.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
      # Upload pipeline log in jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds      
      - name: Upload pipeline Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: jenkins-static-image-pipeline-log
          path: jenkinsHome/jobs/job/builds
```
### Use your own base image as runtime
This feature is only available in `jfr-static-image-action`. You can specify the base image in `baseImage`. For instance, if you want to use npm official image as the base runtime, you can specify 'node:18.3.0' as input and then you can use `npm` in your Jenkinsfile. An alternative way to implement is declaring in the JCasC.
```Yaml
      - name: Jenkins pipeline with the static image
        id: jenkins_pipeline_base_image
        uses:
          ./jfr-static-image-action
        env:
          JENKINS_AWS_KEY: 123456
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins_container.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml
          baseImage: 'node:18.3.0'  
```

## A small demo about how to use these actions
The [Demo project](https://github.com/Cr1t-GYM/JekinsTest) can teach you how to build a SpringBoot project with these actions.
