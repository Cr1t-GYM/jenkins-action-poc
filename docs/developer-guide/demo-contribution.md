# How to contribute to the demo repo
1. Firstly, you need to fork the demo repository.
2. When you add the new demo, you need to follow the structure of the current demo repository. For example, if the new demo is called “foo”, you need to create a new folder called “foo” under the demo directory.
3. You will need to add a specific README.md in the new demo directory.
4. You will need to add a short description about this new demo in the repository main README.md, which can be found in the root path of the directory.
